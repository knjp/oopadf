   GMNLMS.m: using Gaussian mixture model for each coefficients (NLMS algorithm)

   GMRLSDCD.m: using Gaussian mixture model for each coefficients (RLS-DCD algorithm)

In GSNLMS, each coefficient of the adaptive filter is modeled as a sigle Gaussian.
Each coefficient has three parameters to update its Gaussian model.

Namely,
   forgetmu:   \delta_m in the equation (11) of the ISCAS 2019 paper.
   forgetstd:  \delta_s in the equation (12) of the ISCAS 2019 paper.
   bwidth:     Band width of the Gaussian model.
and same values are used for every coefficients of the adaptive filter.

The Gaussian model and its update are implemented in the class file VGSM.m which is
independent of the adaptive algorithm used.

GSNLMS.m contins

  initAlgorithm:
    Automatically called at the beginning of the simulation.
    Initializing the parameters of the algorithm.

  update:
    Update formula of the NLMS algorithm using the Gaussian model.

t1.m is an example of the simulation using GSNLMS.
