How to execute simulations

1. Select adaptive algorithm
   Sample implementaion of the LMS, NLMS, RLS, and RLS-DCE algorithms are provided

2. Generate an object of the algorithm:
     e.g., nlms = NLMS(filterorder)


3. Select channel model  + input-output signals (e.g.: SystemBaseLinear)
     For using SystemBaseLinear.m, coefficients of the unknown system is needed.
     e.g.,  SystemBaseLinear(unknownsystem)

4. Generate simulation object
     e.g.,  s = ADFsimulation(algorithms)

5. Execusion
     e.g., s.simulation()
     At the end of simulation, two figures are popuped, MSE, and MSD characteristics.

*** s1.m is a simplest example of the steps above.
